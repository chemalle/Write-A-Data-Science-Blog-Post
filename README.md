## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:</br>
1. What programming languages are often used in Brazil to orient a business focused in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? </br>
2. What languages are next level up learning for most programmers? </br>
3. How is the relationship between the language people want to work with and those who want to learn? </br>
