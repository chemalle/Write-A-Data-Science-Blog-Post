## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:</br>
1. What programming languages are often used in Brazil to orient a business focused in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? </br>
2. As my proposal is to look for professionals regarding machine learning tools and techniques I added a filter to understand how hard will be my journey to search for those professionals. </br>
3. At this point as an enterpreneur I believe most succesful business comes from people who loves what works with. </br>
